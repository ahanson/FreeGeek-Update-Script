# Install Script:

Here's my fork of FreeGeek Chicago's old Install Script.
It's meant to be more modular and have more error/version checking built into it.
I need to test it in virtualbox/vagrant/elsewhere before using it.

## What it needs to support:
* Kubuntu 14.04
* Xubuntu 14.04
* Generic Ubuntu 16.04
* Linux Mint 18.3 XFCE
